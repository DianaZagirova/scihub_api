"Social theories of aging provide the basis of all relevant practice interventions, policies, programs and research. They evolve and change over time, based upon new knowledge gleaned from additional experience and research, as well as a more enlightened understanding of populations-at-risk and the psychological and social conditions that affect the well-being of such older adults. It is important to assess theories critically in order to use them judiciously. This abstract develops social theories that have evolved in the United States since the early 20th century to the present. They are presented in three main categories: Social Theories, Psychological Theories, and a combination of the two that recognizes the interaction between people and their social environments. Attention is also given to Spirituality and Aging, and to Biological considerations, particularly in regard to Sexuality and Aging. The authors contends that most theories are worthy of consideration, and none are necessarily applicable to everyone. The authors thank Prof. of social work Adelphi University Janice Wood Wetzel for the materials and help in writing this abstract."
"The present paper is a prospective examination, using data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA-1 and CSHA-2), of the hypothesis that self-reported left-handers die earlier than right-handers. Persons over age 65 receiving a clinical evaluation in 1991 (n = 2786) as part of CSHA-1 were recontacted in 19956. At baseline, the sample showed a trend for the expected cross-generational decline in nonright-handedness with increasing age (3.2% of those aged 6574 reported being left-handers while 2.1% were left-handers in the 85+ age group). At follow-up, there were no significant differences in mortality between self-reported right-handers (52.6% died), left-handers (56.8%), and ambidexters (46.6%). The Odds Ratio was 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.721.93) for left- compared to right-handers. There was no evidence that being left-handed increased the risk of death in this sample of elderly Canadians."
"A severe challenge to the idea that mitochondrial DNA mutations play a major role in the aging process in mammals is that clear loss-of-function mutations accumulate only to very low levels (under 1% of total) in almost any tissue, even by very old age. Their accumulation is punctate: some cells become nearly devoid of wild-type mitochondrial DNA and exhibit no activity for the partly mitochondrially encoded enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Such cells accumulate in number with aging, suggesting that they survive indefinitely, which is itself paradoxical. The reductive hotspot hypothesis suggests that these cells adjust their metabolism to use plasma membrane electron transport as a substitute for the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the reoxidation of reduced dinucleotides, and that, like mitochondrial electron transport, this process is imperfect and generates superoxide as a side-effect. This superoxide, generated on the outside of the cell, can potentially initiate classical free radical chemistry including lipid peroxidation chain reactions in circulating material such as lipoproteins. These, in turn, can be toxic to mitochondrially nonmutant cells that import them to satisfy their cholesterol requirements. Thus, the relatively few cells that have lost oxidative phosphorylation capacity may be toxic to the rest of the body. In this minireview, recent results relevant to this hypothesis are surveyed and approaches to intervening in the proposed process are discussed."
"There are many hypotheses about the biological aging. Some error and programme hypotheses are explained and compared with another by examples. The action of stochastic and genetic factors is acknowledged generally, but there are different opinions on the question about a genetic ""programme"". At the same time there is an effort to integrate some alternative conceptions. By increasing appreciation of evolutional aspects too the interest are pointed out to biological longevity assurance mechanisms and their importance for the maximum lifespan of species or individuals."
"Current evidence strongly indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are widely implicated in the inflammatory process. However, mechanistic information is not readily available on the extent to which ROS/RNS contributes to the proinflammatory states of the aging process. The involvement of the underlying inflammation during the aging process and the molecular delineation of anti-inflammatory action of calorie restriction (CR) is described. Age-related upregulations of NF-kappaB, IL-beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible NO synthase are all attenuated by CR. The suppression of the NF-kappaB activation was accomplished by blocking the dissociation of inhibitory IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta by CR. These findings provide underlying molecular insights into the anti-inflammatory action of CR in relation to the aging process. Based on these and other available data, it is suggested that the ""Inflammation Hypothesis of Aging"" supports the molecular basis of the inflammatory process as a plausible cause of the aging process."
"This article reviews the application of information-theoretical analysis, employing measures of entropy and mutual information, for the study of aging and aging-related diseases. The research of aging and aging-related diseases is particularly suitable for the application of information theory methods, as aging processes and related diseases are multi-parametric, with continuous parameters coexisting alongside discrete parameters, and with the relations between the parameters being as a rule non-linear. Information theory provides unique analytical capabilities for the solution of such problems, with unique advantages over common linear biostatistics. Among the age-related diseases, information theory has been used in the study of neurodegenerative diseases (particularly using EEG time series for diagnosis and prediction), cancer (particularly for establishing individual and combined cancer biomarkers), diabetes (mainly utilizing mutual information to characterize the diseased and aging states), and heart disease (mainly for the analysis of heart rate variability). Few works have employed information theory for the analysis of general aging processes and frailty, as underlying determinants and possible early preclinical diagnostic measures for aging-related diseases. Generally, the use of information-theoretical analysis permits not only establishing the (non-linear) correlations between diagnostic or therapeutic parameters of interest, but may also provide a theoretical insight into the nature of aging and related diseases by establishing the measures of variability, adaptation, regulation or homeostasis, within a system of interest. It may be hoped that the increased use of such measures in research may considerably increase diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and the fundamental theoretical mathematical understanding of aging and disease."
"A review of the literature suggests that an intracellular zinc deficiency may be the primary cause of the aging process. Zinc-metalloenzymes play an important role in many aspects of cellular metabolism including DNA replication, repair and transcription. The main enzymes affected by zinc deficiency may be specific for each cell type. Depending on which zinc enzymes are ""overvulnerable"", zinc deficiency may result in accumulation of useless (or toxic) materials, malproduction of essential proteins, a neoplastic change or cell death, thus explaining the variability in aging patterns in different cell types. There is no simple and reliable index of zinc status in humans and a therapeutic trial may be needed to establish zinc deficiency. Finding a zinc-compound which can enter the cell and avoid the development of intracellular zinc deficiency may retard the aging process and postpone age-related diseases."
"Compromised theory of mind (ToM) can be explained either by a failure to implement specific representational capacities (mental state representations) or by more general executive selection demands. In older adult populations, evidence supporting affected executive functioning and cognitive ToM in normal aging are reported. However, links between these two functions remain unclear. In the present paper, we address these shortcomings by using a specific task of ToM and classical executive tasks. We studied, using an original cognitive ToM task, the effect of age on ToM performances, in link with the progressive executive decline. 96 elderly participants were recruited. They were asked to perform a cognitive ToM task, and 5 executive tests (Stroop test and Hayling Sentence Completion Test to appreciate inhibitory process, Trail Making Test and Verbal Fluency for shifting assessment and backward span dedicated to estimate working memory capacity). The results show changes in cognitive ToM performance according to executive demands. Correlational studies indicate a significant relationship between ToM performance and the selected executive measures. Regression analyzes demonstrates that level of vocabulary and age as the best predictors of ToM performance. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that ToM deficits are related to age-related domain-general decline rather than as to a breakdown in specialized representational system. The implications of these findings for the nature of social cognition tests in normal aging are also discussed."
"Testing drugs for anti-aging effects has historically been conducted in mouse life-span studies, but are costly and time consuming, and more importantly, difficult to recapitulate in humans. In addition, life-span studies in mice are not well suited to testing drug combinations that target multiple factors involved in aging. Additional paradigms for testing therapeutics aimed at slowing aging are needed. A new paradigm, designated as the Geropathology Grading Platform (GGP), is based on a standardized set of guidelines developed to detect the presence or absence of low-impact histopathological lesions and to determine the level of severity of high-impact lesions in organs from aged mice. The GGP generates a numerical score for each age-related lesion in an organ, summed for total lesions, and averaged over multiple mice to obtain a composite lesion score (CLS). Preliminary studies show that the platform generates CLSs that increase with the age of mice in an organ-dependent manner. The CLSs are sensitive enough to detect changes elicited by interventions that extend mouse life span, and thus help validate the GGP as a novel tool to measure biological aging. While currently optimized for mice, the GGP could be adapted to any preclinical animal model."
"Mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules are believed to play key roles in the aging process. Characterization of age-related changes to cardiac mitochondria has been complicated by the fact that two distinct populations of mitochondria exist in the myocardium: subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM). We investigated whether differences in hydrogen peroxide production (H2O2) and oxidative stress existed between cardiac SSM and IFM isolated from young (6 mo) and old (24 mo) male Fischer-344 rats. There was a significant increase in oxidative stress levels (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified proteins, protein carbonyls, and malondialdehyde) in IFM with age. In contrast, only protein carbonyls were elevated in SSM with age. Significant age-related increases in MnSOD, GPX, and CAT activities were detected in IFM, while in SSM, MnSOD, and GPX activities increased with age and CAT activity declined. These increases in antioxidant enzyme activity likely occurred in response to increased mitochondrial production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, SSM produced more H2O2 with age, while the increase in IFM was not significant, but this may be due to the higher antioxidant enzyme activity observed in IFM compared with SSM. Finally, reduced glutathione levels were significantly lower in IFM compared with SSM in both young and old rats, while glutathione reductase activity was not different with age or mitochondrial subpopulations, indicating increased consumption of glutathione. The accumulation of oxidant-induced damage in IFM may be a major contributing factor to the age-related alterations in myocardial function. Our results emphasize the importance of studying both mitochondrial populations when attempting to elucidate the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to myocardial aging."
"As demographic drift among health care providers mimics that of the larger population, it becomes increasingly clear that theory pertaining to the impact of aging on cognitive processing should inform the continuing education efforts designed for health care professionals. The purpose of this article is to offer a critical review of the major theories in this area and outline a sample of the implications that can be derived from these views. Research articles examining the relationship between age and physician performance were identified using MEDLINE, PsychLit, and ERIC. In addition, the psychology literature on age-related changes in cognitive processing was reviewed. Evidence from the medical education literature and psychological theory suggest the importance of increased environmental supports, decreased time demands, and peer review programs as barriers against the impact of aging. The implications of these findings include the potential to tailor continuing education (and physician remediation) efforts toward the age-related abilities/deficiencies of individual physicians."
"The nucleolus is the cellular site of ribosome biosynthesis. At this site, active ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes are rapidly transcribed by RNA polymerase I (pol I) molecules. Recent advances in our understanding of the pol I transcription system have indicated that regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis is a critical factor in cell growth. Importantly, the same signaling networks that control cell growth and proliferation and are deregulated in cancer appear to control pol I transcription. Therefore, the study of the biochemical basis for growth regulation of pol I transcription can provide basic information about the nuclear signaling network. Hopefully, this information may facilitate the search for drugs that can inhibit the growth of tumor cells by blocking pol I activation. In addition to its function in ribosome biogenesis, recent studies have revealed the prominent role of the nucleolus in cell senescence. These findings have stimulated a new wave of research on the functional relationship between the nucleolus and aging. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some current topics in the area of nucleolus biology, and it has been written for a general readership."
"Dignity and independence are widely considered as core concepts to aging well, yet little research has explored how older adults perceive these issues in the context of community life. Moreover, little is known regarding the ways in which the broader public views and enhances aging with dignity and independence with their older residents. Using participatory action research, multiple methods of qualitative inquiry, and tenets of appreciative inquiry, this article reports on a community-based initiative aimed to better understand the positive aspects of aging with dignity and independence. Synthesized findings yielded 6 ""actionable themes"": (1) meaningful involvement, (2) aging in place, (3) respect and inclusion, (4) communication and information, (5) transportation and mobility, and (6) health and well-being. The findings invoke a new paradigm for community aging that highlights the unique contributions of older adults as a core social resource. Implications for mobilizing community action to promote aging with dignity and independence are discussed."
"Aging is a universal and inevitable phenomenon that affects nearly all animal species. It can be considered the product of an interaction between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which in turn influence longevity that varies between and within species. It has been proposed not only that the aging process is under genetic control, but that it can also be considered a result of the failure of homeostasis due to the accumulation of damage. This review article discusses these issues, focusing on the function of genes that associate with aging and longevity, as well as on the molecular mechanisms that control cell survival and maintenance during aging."
"The Microbiome Theory of Aging (MTA) explains how microbial imbalance in the intestinal tract, which is also referred to as dysbiosis, causes health problems that accelerate biological aging. The underlying mechanisms involved include increased inflammation, elevated levels of zonulin, destruction of intestinal tight junctions, and intestinal permeability, which allow lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to leak into systemic circulation. LPS is a powerful endotoxin that causes chronic inflammation throughout the body. Chronic inflammation is associated with chronic diseases and the acceleration of biological aging. Postbiotic metabolites are compounds that are created by probiotic bacteria in the colon. Postbiotic metabolites have been called the new frontier in microbiome science due to their key roles in regulating the structure and function of the gut microbiome and many aspects of human health."
"In the present review we discuss the potential use of two long-lived mice of the genus Peromyscus--the white-footed mouse (P. leucopus) and the deer mouse (P. maniculatus) maximum lifespan potential approximately 8 years for both--to test predictions of theories about aging from the oxidative stress theory, mitochondrial theory and inflammatory theory. Previous studies have shown that P. leucopus cells exhibit superior antioxidant defense mechanisms and lower cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than do cells of the house mouse, Mus musculus (maximum lifespan approximately 3.5 years). We present new data showing that mitochondria in P. leucopus cells produce substantially less ROS than mitochondria in M. musculus cells, and that P. leucopus mitochondria exhibit superior stress resistance to those of M. musculus. We also provide evidence that components of the DNA repair system (e.g., pathways involved in repair of DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation) are likely to be more efficient in P. leucopus than in M. musculus. We propose that mitochondrial stress resistance, ROS detoxification pathways and more efficient DNA repair contribute to the previously documented resistance of P. leucopus cells toward oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The link between these three pathways and species longevity is discussed."
"The membrane pacemaker hypotheses of metabolism and aging are distinct, but interrelated hypotheses positing that increases in unsaturation of lipids within membranes are correlated with increasing basal metabolic rate and decreasing longevity, respectively. The two hypotheses each have evidence that either supports or contradicts them, but consensus has failed to emerge. In this review, we identify sources of weakness of previous studies supporting and contradicting these hypotheses and suggest different methods and lines of inquiry. The link between fatty acyl composition of membranes and membrane-bound protein activity is a central tenet of the membrane pacemaker hypothesis of metabolism, but the mechanism by which unsaturation would change protein activity is not well defined and, whereas fatty acid desaturases have been put forward by some as the mechanism behind evolutionary differences in fatty acyl composition of phospholipids among organisms, there have been no studies to differentiate whether desaturases have been more affected by natural selection on aging and metabolic rate than have elongases or acyltransferases. Past analyses have been hampered by potentially incorrect estimates of the peroxidizability of lipids and longevity of study animals, and by the confounding effect of phylogeny. According to some authors, body mass may also be a confounding effect that should be taken into account, though this is not universally accepted. Further research on this subject should focus more on mechanisms and take weaknesses of past studies into account."
"Biodegradable plastic bags (BPBs), meant for eco-friendly, often inadequately degrade in compost, leading to microplastic pollution. In this study, the effect of Fenton-like reaction with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (NMs) on the plastisphere microorganisms' evolution and the BPBs' aging mechanism was revealed by co-composting of food waste with BPBs for 40 days. The establishment of the Fenton-like reaction was confirmed, with the addition of Fenton-like reagent treatments resulting in an increase of 57.67% and 37.75% in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels during the composting, compared to the control group. Moreover, the structural characterization reveals that increasing oxygen content continuously generates reactive free radicals on the surface, leading to the formation of oxidative cavities. This process results in random chain-breaking, significantly reducing molecular weights by 39.27% and 38.81%, thus showcasing a deep-seated transformation in the plastic's molecular structure. Furthermore, the microbial network suggested that the Fenton-like reaction enriched plastisphere keystone species, thus accelerating the BPBs' aging. Additionally, the Fenton-like reaction improved compost maturity and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. These results reveal the bio-chemical mechanisms of BPBs aging and random chain-breaking by the Fenton-like reaction, under alternating oxidative/anoxic conditions of composting and provide a new insight to resolve the BPBs' pollutions."
"The neuronal tissue is notable for its unique regulation of the immune system, response to DNA damage, endurance against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and control of inflammatory pathways. Here, I discuss some uniqueness of the brain's aging process in light of the free radical theory of aging, DNA-damage accumulation, inflammaging, and aging as a consequence of a programmed developmental process. Key points include (i) the resilience of the neuronal tissue to oxidative stress; (ii) the neuron's efficiency in repairing learning-induced DNA damage, even with fewer repair pathways than other cell types; (iii) TLR9 and NFκB at the intersection of memory and inflammation; (iv) RELA linking the skin-brain axis during development, DNA damage response, and pro-inflammatory control; (v) PARP1 at the crossroad of all discussed aging theories. Data points to a ""burden threshold"" where the beneficial regulations of distinct pathways shift toward neurotoxic activities."
"False memories refer to falsely remembering something that did not happen or that happened differently. The effects of age on episodic memory underlie both the decline in real memories and the increase in false memories. But, what is the richness and what is the feeling of reality of false memories in the elderly? This mini-review on false memory in young and older adults presents the results from the literature using one of the most used paradigms in the laboratory to study false memories - the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. This paradigm generally consists in the presentation of semantically associated items-lists (words or images) related to a non-presented critical lure (e.g., bed, rest, awake …, the critical lure is sleep). During free recall or recognition tests, the participants regularly produce false memories (intrusions or false recognitions of the critical lures), increasingly with aging. We specifically ask the question of the richness of the false memory trace in young and older adults in terms of contextual associations (What-Where-When-Details binding) and phenomenological characteristics (remembering, knowing, guessing). We propose to examine this issue using a naturalistic episodic memory task via navigation in a virtual environment enriched with series of associated elements (e.g., vegetables stand) linked to non-presented critical lures (e.g., carrots). Based on preliminary results, we propose an integrative model of memory trace which can explain the differences observed between young and old people on the richness of their false memories."
"A growing body of data supports a view that skeletal muscle's response after mechanical loading does not always result in the classically reported ""injury response."" Furthermore, current evidence supports a model of muscle adaptation and/or maladaptation, distinct from overt injury, in which myofiber degeneration and inflammation do not contribute as significantly as once reported even in aged populations."
"There is currently little consensus regarding what must be explained by theories of cognitive aging. In the present article, four empirical generalizations that seem to imply certain constraints in theorizing are identified. These generalizations, and their possible implications or constraints, are that (1) age-related differences are found in a wide range of cognitive variables, implying that either a large number of specific factors or a small number of general factors must be contributing to the age-related differences; (2) the age-related influences on different cognitive variables are not independent, and unique age-related influences appear to be few in number and small in magnitude, implying that some fairly general factors need to be postulated to account for the shared age-related influences; (3) only a small proportion of distinct age-related variance occurs late in practice and at long presentation durations, implying that adequate explanations must include factors operating when the individuals are just beginning to perform the task and when the stimuli can first be registered; and (4) measures of how quickly very simple cognitive tasks can be performed share considerable age-related variance with many cognitive variables, implying that factors related to simple processing efficiency need to be incorporated into the explanations."
"OBJECTIVE: Aging and AD are associated in some way, then it is reasonable to ask whether or not it is possible to age without AD inexorably appearing at any moment, depending on the period of life. Therefore, the goal of this review is to verify, in light of some aging theories, the prevalence of AD. METHODS: For the purpose of this manuscript, the indexers <i>Alzheimer</i>, <i>aging</i>, <i>Alzheimer</i>, and <i>aging</i> were considered; <i>theories of aging</i> were researched. The research was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Elsevier, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The most common subjects in the papers analyzed for this manuscript were aging and Alzheimer's disease. The association between Alzheimer and theories of aging seems inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, the general idea is that AD is associated with aging in such a way that almost all people will present this disease; however, it is plausible to consider that the increase in life expectancy will generate a high prevalence of AD. In a general sense, it seems that the theories of aging explain the origin of AD under superlative and catastrophic considerations and use more biomolecular data than social or behavioral data as the bases of analysis, which may be the problem."
"The current review focuses on the connection of telomerase and telomeres with aging. In this review, we describe the changes in telomerase and telomere length (TEL) during development, their role in carcinogenesis processes, and the consequences of reduced telomerase activity. More specifically, the connection of TEL in peripheral blood cells with the development of aging‑associated diseases is discussed. The review provides systematic data on the role of telomerase in mitochondria, the biology of telomeres in stem cells, as well as the consequences of the forced expression of telomerase (telomerization) in human cells. Additionally, it presents the effects of chronic stress exposure on telomerase activity, the effect of TEL on fertility, and the effect of nutraceutical supplements on TEL. Finally, a comparative review of the chronographic theory of aging, presented by Olovnikov is provided based on currently available scientific research on telomere, telomerase activity, and the nature of aging by multicellular organisms."
"Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Under MA, a reduced intensity of selection with age results in accumulation of late-acting deleterious mutations. Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Recent studies suggest that the mitochondrial genome is a major player in ageing. It therefore seems plausible that the MA and AP models will be relevant to genomes within the cytoplasm. This possibility has not been considered previously. We explore whether patterns of covariation between fitness and ageing across 25 cytoplasmic lines, sampled from a population of Drosophila melanogaster, are consistent with the genetic associations predicted under MA or AP. We find negative covariation for fitness and the rate of ageing, and positive covariation for fitness and lifespan. Notably, the direction of these associations is opposite to that typically predicted under AP."
"Currently, the oxidative stress (or free radical) theory of aging is the most popular explanation of how aging occurs at the molecular level. While data from studies in invertebrates (e.g., C. elegans and Drosophila) and rodents show a correlation between increased lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress (and in some cases reduced oxidative damage to macromolecules), direct evidence showing that alterations in oxidative damage/stress play a role in aging are limited to a few studies with transgenic Drosophila that overexpress antioxidant enzymes. Over the past eight years, our laboratory has conducted an exhaustive study on the effect of under- or overexpressing a large number and wide variety of genes coding for antioxidant enzymes. In this review, we present the survival data from these studies together. Because only one (the deletion of the Sod1 gene) of the 18 genetic manipulations we studied had an effect on lifespan, our data calls into serious question the hypothesis that alterations in oxidative damage/stress play a role in the longevity of mice."
"We evaluated the debates concerning Brinley plots and the associated theories of age-related slowing. We concluded that an explicit debate regarding a single-factor, general slowing model was no longer a debate as most, if not all, agree to the disconfirmation of that model. We address sources of confusion in the debates that have muddled the areas of genuine disagreement. When the confusion is lifted, the remaining debate centers, rightly, on evaluation of theories of aging. We show that Brinley plot analyses can lead to both falsely accepting and falsely rejecting theories of age-related slowing. Although plotting data most certainly can assist with the evaluation of cognitive theory, we argue that models of performance and learning must play a more central role in advancing theories of cognitive aging."
"Prosociality refers to a broad set of behavioral, motivational, cognitive, affective, and social processes that contribute to, and/or are focused on, the welfare of others. This overview summarizes 10 articles included in the special issue on this topic. In discussing this research relative to existing theories, we situate this work within Penner et al.'s (Annual Review of Psychology, 56, 2005, 365-392) multilevel framework that recognizes distinct yet integrated levels of analysis to characterize micro- (i.e., intraindividual), meso- (i.e., interpersonal), and macro- (i.e., sociocultural and organizational contexts) level effects. While there is some evidence for lifespan continuity in prosocial dispositions at the micro level, the influences of long-term learning and socialization processes at the meso and macro levels are likely to be maximized in older age. Aside from formal voluteering, the adult lifespan development of prosociality has only recently received attention, especially with respect to influences beyond the micro level. This special issue encompasses research examining developmental change and stability in prosociality that collectively cuts across levels of analysis to inform theories in both adult development and aging and prosociality more generally. We propose future directions that take an integrative approach to understanding the development of prosociality by considering interactions among micro, meso, and macro levels.

"Vascular aging, characterized by structural and functional alterations of the vascular wall, is a hallmark of aging and is tightly related to the development of cardiovascular mortality and age-associated vascular pathologies. Over the last years, extensive and ongoing research has highlighted several sophisticated molecular mechanisms that are involved in the pathophysiology of vascular aging. A more thorough understanding of these mechanisms could help to provide a new insight into the complex biology of this non-reversible vascular process and direct future interventions to improve longevity. In this review, we discuss the role of the most important molecular pathways involved in vascular ageing including oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, extracellular matrix metalloproteinases activity, epigenetic regulation, telomere shortening, senescence and autophagy."
"Although the relevant knowledge base is still impoverished, the time may be appropriate to attempt to develop and investigate formal models of cognitive aging that incorporate explicit mechanisms to account for age differences frequently observed in measures of cognitive functioning. An initial model based on an associative network metaphor is described, in which age declines in fluid or process aspects of cognition are attributed to a reduction in either the number of simultaneously active nodes, the maximum allowable activation, or the rate of propagating activation between nodes. Results from a computer simulation are consistent at a first level of approximation with many cognitive aging phenomena, and the model is shown to provide a plausible account of age differences in an area that has previously resisted explanation. Although this particular model is only one of many that could be formulated at the present time, it is argued that more rapid progress in theoretical understanding of cognitive aging phenomena will be achieved by attempting to specify one's assumptions and hypotheses in a formal and explicit manner."
